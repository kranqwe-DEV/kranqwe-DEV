- 👋 Hi, I’m @kranqwe-DEV
- 👀 I’m interested in football and drums.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to play the drums so I can make a future out of it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making video games, websites and other aplications.
- 📫 How to reach me: it's in my twitch https://www.twitch.tv/kranqwe
- 😄 Pronouns: who actually uses pronouns? I'm a guy so what do you think my pronouns are?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've had many injuries in the past, and got over all of them.
- ✅ I don't support LGBTQ+ rights
